# Style guide
This contains a comprehensible style guide for all files to
follow.

## Naming
Darken CSS is **always** Darken CSS and not something else.
Do not ever use Darken-CSS, **unless** linking to our GitHub
organization or on our repositories.

Do not also use Dark CSS, as it's not the official name.

## Using capitals often
Don't use capitals in a sentence like this:

"This is our GitHub **Organization Link**:
https://github.com/darken-css. Follow our
**Organization**."

This marks use of improper grammar. Don't do something like
this **unless** it is a *title* (e.g., GitHub).
