# Getting started guide
If you're new and want to include Darken CSS in your project, here's a guide to it.

## Installing on your website
The first step is well to install Darken CSS. To download a copy, [click here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/darken-css/Darken-CSS/blob/main/main.css).

Then, include this tag at the `head` element of your website:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/where-you-put-darken-css/main.css">
```

`/where-you-put-darken-css` defines where Darken CSS has been downloaded on. You need to change this to where you put it. An example is `/static/css`.
